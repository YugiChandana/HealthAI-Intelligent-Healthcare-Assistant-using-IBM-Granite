Scenarios:

Scenario 1:A user inputs their symptoms into the Disease Prediction system, describing issues like persistent headache, fatigue, and mild fever. The system analyzes the symptoms along with the patient's profile and health data to provide potential condition predictions, including likelihood assessments and recommended next steps.

Scenario 2:A user needs personalized treatment recommendations for a diagnosed condition. By entering their condition in the Treatment Plans generator, the AI processes the information along with patient data to create a comprehensive, evidence-based treatment plan that includes medications, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up testing.

Scenario 3:A user wants insights about their health trends. Using the Health Analytics dashboard, they can visualize their vital signs over time (heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, etc.) and receive AI-generated insights about potential health concerns and improvement recommendations.

Scenario 4:A user has a health-related question. Through the Patient Chat interface, they can ask any medical query and receive a clear, empathetic response that includes relevant medical facts, acknowledges limitations, and suggests when to seek professional medical advice.
